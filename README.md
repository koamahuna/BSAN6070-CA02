# BSAN6070-CA02
#Name of project Naive Bayes Classifier CA02

#Project Overview In this project, I have explained the logic behind a naive bayes classifier. The code takes data from google drive and prepares it for analysis before running 
a test. Accuracy score is printed out at the end.

#Config Instructions This program was written in Google Colab and should run there easily. It was written on a Windows operating system.

#Installation Instructions The first block of code includes the packages necessary for this to run but i will list them here as well: os, NumPy, Counter from Collections, GaussianNB from sklearn.naive_bayes, accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics, drive from google.colab.

#Operating instructions You will need to build a file path identical to mine in order to have the data be drawn in appropriately by the script. 

#A list of files included I have included a python notebookcompete with the code and analysis written by me. Additionally I have added the data file. It is in a zip folder to save space so you will unzip it and upload it into your preferred environment to run it.
