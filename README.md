Repository for classwork and assignments from Intro to Machine Learning, BSAN-6070 #Name of project Exploratory Data Analysis of Air Quality in Indian States-CA01

#Project Overview In this project I clean some data regarding the air quality in various Indian states. After the initial clean I begin to use visualizations to look for trends in the data and make some conclusions about how the air quality trends have changed over time.

#Config Instructions This program was written in Google Colab and should run there easily. UIt was written on a Windows operating system.

#Installation Instructions The first block of code includes the packages necessary for this to run but i will list them here as well: NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, and SimpleImputer from sklearn.impute

#Operating instructions The main thing to mention here is that you need to add an argument to the initial reading of the csv file. pd.read_csv('data.csv', encoding='cp1252' should solve any issues.

#A list of files included I have included a python notebookcompete with the code and analysis written by me. Additionally I have added the data file. It is in a zip folder to save space so you will unzip it and upload it into your preferred environment to run it.
